    <h1>Draconian D-Day</h1>
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>
      Draconian D-Day is a Run-and-Gun platformer with mobility elements inspired by <em>Deadbolt</em> and <em>Castlevania IV</em>.
      The game features a herpetologist (reptile researcher) who stumbles into a neo-Nazi conspiracy plot in the depths of the South American tepui jungles, 
      and must stop their plot to resurrect Hitler and end the world. 
      The 2D pixelated graphics show cartoonish animations of goring these traitors to humanity with your animalistic arsenal.

    <h2>Creative Inspirations</h2>
    <p>
      Over this summer, I played <em>Castlevania IV</em>, and while I enjoyed the mechanics, they felt more based off of placement and 
      cheesing fights rather than allowing the player to react to developing situations. I expected this from older games, but still 
      knew there was more potential out of its systems. Talking with my brother who loves animals, particularly lizards, he mentioned 
      how he eventually wants to explore the relatively untouched tepuis of northern South America. Combining this with the classic 
      conspiracy theory of South America being the great hiding spot for the Nazis post-WWII, this gave me the idea to combine the two 
      into a game that could play into my sense of humor well, as well as being a relatively simple genre for a beginner developer to work with.

    <h2>Future Plans for This Game</h2>
    <p>
      First, I need to create a design document overview for this game. I know how it will start and end, but need to decide how much 
      middle is needed to be fun. Marketing wise, the game is intended for the common person who is pro-killing Nazis but doesn’t enjoy 
      the first-person shooter or real-time strategy genres that this idea usually entails in the gaming scene, instead taking it to the 
      ever lovable and easily accessible platformer genre. Overall, I think this game will be a great way to put my personality into a 
      project that can appeal to a wide audience and get my foot into the industry’s door.
